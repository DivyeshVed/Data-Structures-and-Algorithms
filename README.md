# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repo contains all the code that was written while learning about Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.

At Georgia Tech, this class is called CS 1332. I took it in the Fall of 2022, and this repo contains the code that was written to complete the assignments in this class.
We were required to write all the methods that would be implemented in these structures and algorithms. This helped better understand the functionality of these structures and algorithms. 

The following Data Structures and Algorithms were covered:
  1. ArrayLists
  2. LinkedLists (Single, Doubly, Curcular)
  3. Queues, Dequeus, Stacks
  4. Trees (2-4 Trees)
  5. AVLs
  6. Heaps (Min and Max)
  7. HashMaps
  8. BSTs
  9. Sorting:
    Brute Force,
    Bubble Sort,
    Selection Sort,
    Insertion Sort,
    Cocktail Shaker Sort,
    Merge Sort,
    Quick Sort,
    LSD Radix Sort,
    Heap Sort
  10. Pattern Matching:
    Brute Force,
    Boyer-Moore (with and wihtout Galil Rule),
    Knut-Morris-Pratt (KMP),
    Rabin-Karp,
  11. Graphs:
    Breadth-First Search,
    Depth First Search,
    Dijkstra's Shortest Path,
    Prim's MST,
    Kruskal's MST,
  12. Dynamic Programming: 
    Longest Common Subsequence
